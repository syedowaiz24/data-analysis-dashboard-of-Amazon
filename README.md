 ## Ientified KPIs and Their Creation:
 #### 1.Sales (â‚¹1,02,26,625): This is the total revenue generated from sales. 
 It's likely calculated by summing up the sales value of all transactions within the specified period .
 #### 2.Units Sold (33,874):
 This represents the total number of products sold. It's calculated by summing up the quantities of each product sold across all transactions.
 #### 3.Number of Cities (23): 
 This KPI indicates the reach of sales across different cities. It's determined by counting the unique cities where sales transactions occurred.
 #### 4.Number of Orders (82 - inferred): 
 hile "orders" isn't explicitly labeled, the "82" is likely the total number of orders placed. This would be derived by counting the unique transaction IDs or order numbers.  It's a standard sales KPI.
 #### 5.Product-Wise Unit Sales (Bar Chart):
 This visualization shows the number of units sold for each product.  The length of each bar represents the quantity sold for that specific product.  This is calculated by grouping sales data by product and summing up the quantities sold for each product.  The image shows a few examples:
-6267 units of one product
-4168 units of another product
-240 units of another product
-2152 units of another product
